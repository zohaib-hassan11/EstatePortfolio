 * Works out how urgently an enquiry deserves a call back.
 *
 * Deliberately rule-based rather than clever. Every signal it uses is already
 * captured by the website forms, so the answer is instant, free, identical every
 * time, and - most importantly - explainable: `reasonFor()` gives the agent the
 * sentence behind the label. An agent who cannot see why something is hot stops
 * trusting the label, and an untrusted label is worse than none.
 *
 * The rules read structured fields only. Judging intent from the wording of the
 * message ("I have cash ready", "must move before December") needs a model and
 * is deliberately out of scope here.
