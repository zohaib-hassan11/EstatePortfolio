 * The first email to the person who made an enquiry.
 *
 * Two forms. With a `$reply`, the body is an AI answer to their question that
 * has already passed ReplyCheck, and a footnote says it was prepared
 * automatically. Without one, it is the template confirmation, built entirely
 * from the records. The listing card, contact details and office hours are
 * always from the records, never from the model. Neither form repeats the
 * visitor's own text - anyone can type any address into a public form.
 *
 * It is sent in the agent's name, and replies go to the agent's own inbox.
